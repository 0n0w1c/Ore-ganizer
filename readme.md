#### Ore-ganizer

Take control of your resources!

Introduces new versions of the pumpjack and mining drills that spawn the selected resource when placed.

Click the shortcut to open the resource selector and choose a resource.  
Then place a resource drill, pumpjack, or blueprint as usual.

The selected resource remains active until changed or the surface is changed.

Deconstruction removes the resource.

Construction is blocked for invalid combinations or if a required mining technology has not been researched.

No on_tick code or entity tracking — very UPS-friendly.

*New: Map generator preset — “No resources”*  
And now includes the *Aquilo Islands* map generator resource setting (see [FAQ](https://github.com/0n0w1c/Ore-ganizer/blob/main/faq.md)).

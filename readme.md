#### Ore-ganizer  

Take control of your resources!  

Introduces new versions of the pumpjack, and mining drills, which spawn the selected resource when placed.  

Click the shortcut to open the resource selector and pick the resource.  
Then place a resource drill, pumpjack or blueprint as usual.  

Resource selection remains in effect until changed or the surface is changed.  

Deconstruction removes the resource.  

Construction is blocked for invalid combinations or if a technology is required for mining and it is not yet researched.  

No on_tick code or entity tracking, very UPS friendly.

*New: Map generator preset for "No resources"*

#### Runtime settings:  
* Ignore planetary restrictions

#### Important notes:

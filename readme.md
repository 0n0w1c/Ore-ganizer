#### Ore-ganizer

Take control of your resources!

Introduces new versions of the pumpjack and mining drills that spawn the selected resource when placed.

Click the shortcut (or *Control + R*) to open the resource selector and click a resource.  
Then place a resource drill, pumpjack, or blueprint (with resource drills/pumpjacks) as usual.

The selected resource remains active until changed or the surface is changed.

To convert mining drills, press *Control + X* with a stack of mining drills on the player's cursor.

Pipette (Q) on a resource node to auto-select the resource and place a Resource mining drill on the cursor.  

Deconstruction removes the resource.

Construction is blocked for invalid combinations or if a required mining technology has not been researched.  

When placing blueprints of Resource mining drills, they will appear blue and that is expected, just place as usual.  

No on_tick code or entity tracking — very UPS-friendly.  

*New: Map generator preset — “No resources”*  
Includes the *Ice islands* map generator resource setting (see [FAQ](https://github.com/0n0w1c/Ore-ganizer/blob/main/faq.md)).

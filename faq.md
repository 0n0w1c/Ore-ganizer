## Why was the Aquilo Island map generator resource added?

Aquilo map generation works a little differently: ice islands are placed wherever resources are generated.  
So if you choose the *No resources* preset, no islands will be created on Aquilo.  
This resource setting will generate ice islands without resources, producing *vanilla-like* map generation.  

## What effect will it have with other map presets?

If active and left at its default settings, it will generate a few empty ice islands on Aquilo.  
You can experiment with the setting in the *Map Generator* using the *Preview* option.

*Note:* The *Richness* slider has no effect.

## Why was the "Ice island" map generator resource added?

Aquilo map generation works a little differently: islands are placed wherever resources are generated.  
So if the *No resources* preset is selected, no small islands will be created on Aquilo.  
This resource setting will generate islands without resources, producing *vanilla-like* map generation.  

## What effect will it have with other map presets?

If active and default settings, it will generate a few empty islands on Aquilo.  
You can experiment with the setting in the *Map Generator* using the *Preview* option.

*Note:* The *Richness* slider has no effect.
